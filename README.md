# CS 396 Final Project

This repository should contain everything you need for us to grade your final
project, with the exception of any datasets that are larger than 50 MB.

## Important Instructions

In order for us to easily grade your *proposal*, please make sure to include
the following files

- `netids` should include the Net IDs of your team members, with one Net ID per
  line.
- `proposal.pdf` should include a PDF printout of your proposal document. We
  provide a `proposal.tex` as a template which you can edit, but your work
  should be submitted as a PDF.

For future project assignments, you will need to include `update.pdf` and
`report.pdf` files, but those aren't necessary for your proposal.
